Starter kit for automating tasks in everyday front-end development. üë®üèª‚Äçüíª ‚ö°Ô∏è üõ†  ‚ú® ü§ñ

## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

**1.** Make sure you have a recent version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

**2.** Install  [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

> Yarn is a new, modern dependency management tool for JavaScript. It caches every package it downloads so it never needs to download it again. The easiest way to install:

```bash
‚ùØ $ npm install -g yarn
```

**3.** Clone repository either with SSH or with HTTPS.

```bash
‚ùØ $ git clone git@github.com:RamilMamedo/bb8.git
‚ùØ $ git clone https://github.com/RamilMamedo/bb8
```

**4.** Install [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/).

> Gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something. The easiest way to install:

```bash
‚ùØ $ yarn global add gulp-cli
```

**5.** Go to the downloaded folder.

```bash
‚ùØ $ cd bb8
```

**6.** To get start immediately.

```bash
‚ùØ $ yarn start
```

> If you don‚Äôt want to install or configure tools, plugins or any other dependencies. So that you can focus on the code, just create a project, and you‚Äôre good to go.

## Development & Production üöÄ

![Dev Mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38986496/54272233-aeb7b300-459c-11e9-8eeb-82c21ca5fb62.png)

> You can custom setup the project at any time and specify the dependencies that you need in the file **package.json**

**1.**  To install dependencies manually.

```bash
‚ùØ $ yarn
```

**2.** To start development.

```bash
‚ùØ $ yarn dev
```

> If you did everything correctly, it should open a browser with a local server on port **[2020](http://localhost:2020)** and a working **browser-sync**.

**3.** To finalize the project for production.

```bash
‚ùØ $ yarn build
```

## Folder Structures üìÇ

The last command will create a directory called **`build`** inside the current folder.<br>
No configuration or complicated folder structure, just the ready files you need for production:

```
./build/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.min.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fonts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Fontello
